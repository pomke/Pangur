Pangur
======


Installation
------------

Add pangur to your PYTHONPATH or install with:

python setup.py install


Pangur requires some other software which can easily be installed from the 
cheeseshop:

easy_install wtforms sqlalchemy jinja2 werkzeug

You'll probably want a database to connect to as well, I like to use postgres
or sqlite, but anything supported by alchemy should be fine.


Getting Started
