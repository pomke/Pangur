About Listful:

Listful is an example application that shows the basic ideas behind the 
pangur microframework. Listful is also a handy little tool for collaborative 
task management.

Trying it out:

You can run listful with two very easy commands, the first creates the Listful
database (sqlite by default), the second runs a development server on port 8000

> pangur setupdb listful
> pangur run listful

Deploying it:

I like to use gunicorn to deploy my pangur apps behind nginx, see gunicorn.org
for more info, included is a basic gunicorn.conf for running the app that way.
Of course there are a bajillion ways you can deploy pangur as it is a WSGI app,
here are some more ideas: wsgi.org/wsgi/Servers
